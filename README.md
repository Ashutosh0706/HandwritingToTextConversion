# HandwritingToTextConversion
This is a simple handwriting to text converter. This project is built using Python3. It is very easy to use.
You just need to give image of handwritten text as input.
The extracted text from the image in digital form will be the output.
This project will help those who want to rapidy extract the text from a handwritten image.
I have provided 2 codes i.e. 2 .py files.
One will extract the text from handwritten text image.
And the other one will extract both i.e. text from handwritten text image as well as text from digital text image.
